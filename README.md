Data 1202
load libraries and read data files
preview the headers of the file to decide which factors to choose from the headers list to decide the mental health factor
getting a list of countries so I can choose a country of which we have the highest amount of data available
iterating the columns; just making it easier to read through the headers so I can determine which col will be a better representation for the given task
generally from the headers available, the most common links for mental health issues are assosiated with gender,family history,treatment, work interference, seek help, mental health consequences.  since I am more interested to know the results of male and female attributes when it comes to work interference, I am going to find the numbers assosiated with it using graphs in United States since we have the most available information of US
Based on the Data Available on work interference based on gender shows that the male population of  United States is more effected by mental health issues when it comes to productivity in their prespective work life
